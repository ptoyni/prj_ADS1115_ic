## overall features of $\Delta \Sigma$-ADCs
- input signal sampled at comparitevly high frequency (modulator frequency)
- filtered and decimated (down sampled) for output signal
- ratio between modulator and output frequency is _oversampling ratio_
- increasing OSR reduces output noise and output date rate, because more samples are averaged


## Description of ADS1115
- comprises internal voltage reference, clock oscillator and i2c interface
- switched capacitor $\Delta \Sigma$-ADC followed by digital filter
- good attenuation of common mode signals
- input signals are compared to internal voltage reference
- differetial and single ended mode possible, PGA as differential amp
- when in single ended, comparision against ground on negative input of ADC
- single shot and continous mode
- internal buffer register stores most recent sampled signal independent of op mode
