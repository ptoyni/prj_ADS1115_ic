## Work done:
**Lars:**\
- semi full OTA design in XSchem\

**Priyanka:**\
- full fledged OTA design in XSchem\

**Miko:**\

- Analysis of noise transfer in MatLab\
- Documentation of MatLab behavioural\

**Priyanka:**\
- Further OTA design with more complex Opamp\
    - including noise\

**Miko:**\
- Decimation MatLab\
- Documentation template\


## Questions and problems
- What is the actual input to the ADC, what does the accelerometer output?
- Inclusion of PCB level analysis in presentation?
- Evaluation of lab hardware (acc, adc)

- ADC converts analog input signal to digital without loss of information due to nyquist theorem, so that the ADC output over time is the accelerometer output
