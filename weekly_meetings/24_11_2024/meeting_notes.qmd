title: "Meeting notes 24.11.2024"
format: pdf
---

- Lars presents a file with ideas for the final presentation (/ideas/presentation_proposal.html)

- Talk about actual benefits of dividing into two teams, maybe scrap that idea and concentrate on analog section
    - power management
    - internal clock
    - 
    
- Questions for Prof. Meiners   
    - Actual implementation of digital section in ADC?
    - What do we need to develop ourselves vs which components can be bought as IP core?
    - how in-depth should we design the IC? (Alerts, how many analog inputs, PG, fail save, ...)
 

## Todo's until 28.11.2024
- Create very detailed block diagram (Clock, power delivery, integrator, ...)
- get better understanding of $\Delta \Sigma$-ADCs from Book (/resources/literature/Understanding Delta Sigma ADCs) and datasheet
    - spare some time thinking about ADC characterization/measurement ideas
- Install open source IC design tools
