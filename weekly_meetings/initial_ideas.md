title: "Overall plan on how to work in two groups"

## General idea
- Weekly meetings besides lab, date is determined on a weekly basis (ideally on sundays or mondays)

- both teams "present" progress

- discuss what to do until next lab session


## Until next meeting (24.11.24)
- ___READ THE DATASHEET OF ADS1115___ and any additional information you find relevant (look into the bibliography)

- both teams have a look at the interface between $\Delta \Sigma$-Modulator and DSP (1-bit PWM signal), properties, sampling rate, ...

- Specifiying goals for characterizing the ADS1115 ADC:
  - Formulate test setups/ experiment setups for characterization
  - (Maybe) cross reference with datsheet information (e.g. validate datasheet information with test setups)
