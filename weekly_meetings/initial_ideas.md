## General idea
- Weekly meetings besides lab, date is determined on a weekly basis (ideally on sundays or mondays)

- discuss what to do until next lab session


## Until next meeting (24.11.24)
- both teams have a look at the interface between $\Delta \Sigma$-Modulator and DSP (1-bit PWM signal), properties, sampling rate, ...
