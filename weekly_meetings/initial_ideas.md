title: "Overall plan on how to work in two groups"

## General idea
- Weekly meetings besides lab, date is determined on a weekly basis (ideally on sundays or mondays)

- both teams "present" progress

- discuss what to do until next lab session


## Until next meeting (24.11.24)
- ___READ THE DATASHEET OF ADS1115___ and any additional information you find relevant (look into the bibliography)

- both teams have a look at the interface between $\Delta \Sigma$-Modulator and DSP (1-bit PWM signal), properties, sampling rate, ...

- Specifiying goals for characterizing the ADS1115 ADC:
  - Formulate test setups/ experiment setups for characterization
  - (Maybe) cross reference with datsheet information (e.g. validate datasheet information with test setups)

  ## Until next meeting (1.12.24)

- both teams need to work on the Behavioural Model (Matlab Code and Simulink)
- Lars and Miko : design 1 (dsm_l1) 
- Priyanka : updating findings in behavioural model in terms of plots in dsm_l2 and working with matlab dsm_l2
- Aftab: working with simulink of dsm_l2 and understanding of the same

- Installation of OSCII na proper working of it

- (optional) go through the Book in literature
