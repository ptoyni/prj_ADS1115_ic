## 1st Order Modulator Model:
### Comprised of:

- sum block ($\Delta$):
  - one positive and one negativ input
  - 
- discrete-time integrator as accumulator:
  -  realised as: $\frac{z^{-1}}{1-z^{-1}}$
  -  
- comparator (non-linear element):
  - switching threshold defined with 'eps' := $2^{-52}$ = 2.2204e-16
    - essentially switches around '0'-crossovers   
  - output either '1' (on) or '-1' (off)
- feedback path from comparator output to sum block (neg. sign)

### In-Depth description:
##### Input signal:
- Analog signal 
  - Conveniently a sinusoid
    - Is non-linear, yet periodicly predictable


##### Delta ($\Delta$):
- Feedback-node of the system 


##### Integrator/ Loop Filter ($\Sigma$)
- Discrete-time implementation of integrator => accumulator
  - also represents a lowpass filter
  - Includes a delay of one time step.
- Serves as the "loop filter" of our system.
  - Accumulates difference ("error") between input and quantized feedback, including a sample delay.
  - Modeled, using the expression:
  $$
  \frac{z^{-1}}{1-z^{-1}}
  $$
- System relevance:
  1. Accumulation of input signal
  2. Shaping of Quantization Noise ($\textit{Noise Shaping}$)
  

## 2nd Order Modulator Model:
### Comprised of (additional):

- sum block ($\delta$):
  - one positive and one negativ input
- discrete integrator/ loopfilter:
  -  realised as: $\frac{z^{-1}}{1-z^{-1}}$
- coefficient driven gains after integrators and before $\delta$s
