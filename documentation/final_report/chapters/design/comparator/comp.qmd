# Comparator Design

As the output stage of the modulator subsystem of the desired Analog-Digital Converter, the comparator stage of the modulator serves as the quantizing block.

## Model-/ Architecture elaboration

The considered implementation of our comparator utilizes an initial inverter based comparator stage, followed by a latching circuit to account for the reseting within the comparator and the resulting "invalid" outputs it would provide.

### Comparator Stage

)

This circuits behaviour is fundamentally tied to the clock states, leading to either the so called "precharge" phase during low clock levels, or the "amplification" phase during an active clock phase.

(Elaborate briefly on circuit behaviour)

### Latching Circuit

After the StrongArm comparator, as mentioned previously, a latching circuit is implemented for improved validity of the final outputs.
