# Comparator Design

As the output stage of the modulator subsystem of the desired Analog-Digital Converter, the comparator stage of the modulator serves as the quantizing block.

## Model-/ Architecture elaboration

The considered implementation of our comparator utilizes the so call "StrongArm-Latch" architecture, followed by a d-latch to account for the reseting within the comparator 

@strongarm_circuit.
