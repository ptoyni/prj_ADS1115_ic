# Switch Capacitor Design

We are using "CIFB" topology also known as Cascade of integrators, feedback form to realize our design.

Functions of $\Sigma \Delta$ toolbox in MATLAB enables us to realize the NTF function and based upon that we can get our coefficients.

## Capacitor Sizing

As mentioned above, the coefficients translate into capacitor ratios. In the first stage capacitance ratio can be computed as follows:

$$ 
a_1 = \frac{C_1 V_\text{ref}}{C_2} = \frac{C_1 V_\text{dd}}{C_2}
$$

$$
b_1 = \frac{C_1 V_\text{FS}}{M C_2} = \frac{C_1 V_\text{dd}}{C_2}
 $$

The absolute value of $C_{1}$ is computed by thermal noise constraint. Mean-square noise yielding an SNR of 101 dB is 

$$\overline{v_n^2} = \frac{\left(\frac{V_\text{dd}}{2}\right)^2 / 2}{10^{\text{SNR}/10}}$$

The in-band input-referred mean-square noise voltage associated with first integrator:

$$v_n^2 = \frac{kT}{\text{OSR} \cdot C_1}$$

From above equations we can get the value of $C_1$ and $C_2$. For capacitences for the second integrator can be computed from:

$$$c_1 = \frac{C_3}{C_5}$$

$$a_2 = \frac{C_4 V_\text{dd}}{C_5}$$

Since, due to oversampling ratio is high, the in-band thermal noise of the second integrator is heavily attenuated by gain of the first integrator. Therefore, we set $C_4$ is taken 0.1pF. 

## OTA Sizing

For integrator, we first implemented 5 transistor OTA. Using components available in IHP Microelectronics SG13G2 technology. First of all, we need to run the technology sweep to get the response of the OTA at various $V_{gs}$ and $V_{ds}$ values. Then we can use the sweep data to get the optimal graphs in MATLAB.

![Testsweep for LV NMOS g_m/I_d Characterisation](figures/switch_cap/techsweep_nmos.svg){#fig-Nmos_sweep}

We have a similar tesbench for LV_PMOS which to depict their behaviour. We would use the data provided by these sweep to realize the sizing of OTA discussed below @fig-basic_ota

### Choosing $I_{d}$ and $g_{m}$

The value of $I_d$ plays a very important role in the design of the OTA. At the start of each charge-transfer phase, the OTA input terminals are driven such that current in differential switches fully to one side. The magnitude output current of I (bias current) in each half of differential pair. It should be large enough to transfer the charge from input capacitor to integrating capacitor in allowed time.

$$I > \frac{C_1 V_\text{dd}}{T / 4}$$

Next important parameter is $g_m$.In small-signal model of an integrator in charge-transfer phase from which we can see time-constant is

$$
\tau = RC = \frac{C_1 + C_3 + C_1C_3 / C_2}{g_m}
$$

which gives 

$$
g_m = \frac{C_1 + C_3 + C_1C_3 / C_2}{T/48}
$$

Now, we have both the values of $I_d$ and $g_m$. We would divide the two values to get $g_m/I_d$ ratio and check whether it is in moderate region or not. If it is not, we need to adjust the value of $I_d$ and $g_m$ which can be done by increasing the value of $I_d$.

### Choosing W and L parameters

In a design we would have different NMOS and PMOS with different parameters depending upon their presence in design. We have used **Whilson Current Mirror** for creating reference current in our circuit. All NMOS and PMOS in this section would have double $W/L$ compared to the NMOS and PMOS in the differential pair.

We would generate MATLAB scripts or also known as lookup table to generate the required plots for our technology node. In figure $g_m/I_d$ vs $I_d/W$ for NMOS. We can see that $g_m/I_d$ is in moderate region and for various $L$ values corresponding $I_d/W$ values can be see. Choose the length value in such a way that after calculation your $W$ is not less 130nm. Repeat the same procedure for PMOS. You have $W$ and $L$ values for both NMOS and PMOS but keep in mind choose length atleast three or four times of $L_{min}$.
