# Clock-Phase generation

::: {.justify}

The aforementioned delay in the phases of the clocks acting on the switched capacitor can be achieved by the structure in figure @fig-phase_gen. This takes a reference clock signal which provides a signal at the frequency required by the system and outputs four different phases $\phi_1$, $\phi_{1d}$, $\phi_2$ and $\phi_{2d}$. The feedback between the upper and lower strand of the structure ensures the prevention of overlap between $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ and in turn for their respective delayed versions.

By changing the capacitance of the marked inverters the actual delay between $\phi_i$ and $\phi_{id}$ can be controlled. It is worth noting however, that the capacitive load $C_L$ experienced at the outputs of the structure also has an influence on the phase delay, as can be seen in figure @fig-delay_norm

Figure @fig-delay_norm shows the normal delay between $\phi_1$ and $\phi_{1d}$ as well as the non-overlap with $\phi_2$. These curves were generated by simulating the clock generation circuit provided by Boris Murmann [@murmann]. In this, the load capacitance $C_L$ experienced by all outputs as set to 25 fF. The gates used are the standard cells defined by the $sg13g2$ PDK.
