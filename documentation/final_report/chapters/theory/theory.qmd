## System overview of the $\Delta$ $\Sigma$ modulator

Delta-Sigma modulators ($\Delta\Sigma$) are generally speaking 1-bit sampling systems that utilizes the principles of "oversampling".
To start this chapter of, we would like to briefly elaborate on some of the key elements that are commenly utilized by these modulator systems.

The system itself can be represented, using the following block diagram for the case of analog-to-digital conversion.

```

Anti-Aliasing measures have to be considered to ensure a "clean" input signal to the modulator system, without unwanted parasitic components. 

The sampling then discretizes the input signal in time, before the quentization does the same with regard to its value (or amplitude).

The digital filtering is then responsible to transform the discrete signal, which has been creates utilizing oversampling, into a more manageable format, typically utilizing "moving-average filtering".

### Oversampling circuits


### Principle of Noise Shaping

The key advantage that Delta-Sigma Modulation brings to the table is "noise shaping". This is enabled by the feedback structure that is given in our modulator system.

For that, let's observe the following block diagram.

## Switched Capacitor Integrator
(to be cited: Schreier) 

The desired loop filter for the modulator, which is the first and most fundamental building block of our system, will be realised utilizing an active integrator circuit that has a switched capacitance input stage.

A classic implementation of realizing an active integrator would be with the following opamp circuit in figure @opamp_integrator.

(explain basic principle of shown integrator circuit)

There is however the inconvinience, that the resistor on the input is generally a lossy and potentially noisy element for our system.

Therefore, it is worth utilizing the following input structure in figure @opamp_sc_integrator, which leads to a switched-capacitor integrator.

The depicted switches are clocked in a way, that no simultanious high levels will occure.

To derive the system behaviour of this circuitry, let's consider the two phases of operation, given be the switching phases.
