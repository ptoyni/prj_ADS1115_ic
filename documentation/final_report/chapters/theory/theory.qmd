# Theory and Charactersitics of Delta-Sigma Modulators


## Top-Level Overview 
Delta-Sigma modulators ($\Delta\Sigma$) are generally speaking 1-bit sampling systems that utilizes the principles of "oversampling".
To start this chapter of, we would like to briefly elaborate on some of the key elements that are commenly utilized by these modulator systems.

The system itself can be represented, using the following block diagram for the case of analog-to-digital conversion.

```

Anti-Aliasing measures have to be considered to ensure a "clean" input signal to the modulator system, without unwanted parasitic components. 

The sampling then discretizes the input signal in time, before the quentization does the same with regard to its value (or amplitude).

The digital filtering is then responsible to transform the discrete signal, which has been creates utilizing oversampling, into a more manageable format, typically utilizing "moving-average filtering".

## System overview of $\Delta\Sigma$ Modulators

### Oversampling circuits

Oversampling converters offer an alternative to the classical Nyquist-Converters. The latter utilize sampling rates that are either equal or slightly higher than the Nyquist-frequency of the system, meaning at least twice the required signal bandwidth $f_B$, so that the input can be reconstructed reliably afterwards (avoiding aliasing). 
\begin{align}
  f_s \geq 2\cdot f_B 
\end{align}

These converters operate in a way that input samples ...

Oversampling converters utilize sampling rates that are well beyond the minimum required Nyquist-rate, typically sampling at rates that are multiple powers of 2 higher.

The oversampling ratio (OSR) denotes the factor by which the Nyquist rate is exceeded.

\begin{align}
  OSR = \frac{f_s}{2 \cdot f_B}
\end{align}

### Principle of Noise Shaping (1st-Order)

The key advantage that Delta-Sigma Modulation brings to the table is "noise shaping". This is enabled by the feedback structure that is given in our modulator system.

For that, let's observe the following block diagram of a first order model.

![Linear Model of the 1st-Order Modulator](figures/theory/Simple_1stOrder_Mod_sys.png){#fig-loopfilter_sys_1st_order}

It showcases a simple I/O behavioural model of a system that is inherently representative of what a Delta-Sigma modulator is. 

'u' is our input signal, in case of an ADC application it should therefore denote our "analog input", which we will assume to be handled in a discrete fashion. 'v' denotes the output of our feedback system, which should contain sufficient information about our original input (more on the specific extraction later).

The system contains the so called "loopfilter", the elemental block for the desired shaping process. We also include an additive error, representing the error in our output due to quantization. The feedback path includes a unit delay to indicate that past output samples will impact the current computation of the input.

Using the markings $*_1$ and $*_2$, we can derive the transfer behaviour of our system as follows:

\begin{align}
  v &= e + *_2\,;\quad *_2 = (\frac{1}{1-z^{-1}}) \, *_1\,; \quad *_1 = u - v\,z^{-1} \\
  \Rightarrow& *_2 = (\frac{1}{1-z^{-1}})\, (u-v\,z^{-1})\,; v = e + (\frac{1}{1-z^{-1}})\,(u-v\,z^{-1})\\
  \Leftrightarrow&\, v = \frac{u}{1-z^{-1}} - \frac{v\,z^{-1}}{1-z^{-1}} + e \\
  \Leftrightarrow&\, v(1-z^{1}) = u - v\,z^{-1} + e(1-z^{-1}) \\
  \Leftrightarrow&\, v \cancel{-v\,z^{-1}} \cancel{+ v\,z^{-1}} = u + e(1-z^{-1})
\end{align}

This shows the dependency of the output v on the separate terms for our input and the quantization error. We can denote these functions of $z$ as our transfer functions for either the signal ($STF(z) = 1$) or our quantization "noise" ($NTF(z) = 1-z^{-1}$)

\begin{align}
  v = STF(z)\,u + NTF(z)\,e
\end{align}

The Noiseshaping is now privided due to the given NTF, which will apply a high-pass characteristic onto the internal noise. 
As a first general validation of that, if we check over a normalized frequency range of $\omega = [0, \pi]$ we derive for $z = e^{j\omega}$ at either z = e^{j\cdot 0} = 1 or z = e^{j\cdot \pi} = -1. Plugging that into the proposed NTF will lead to:

\begin{align}
  NTF(z) &= 1-z^{-1} \hat{=} 1-\frac{1}{e^{j\omega}} = 0\,; \quad \text{for}\ \omega \rightarrow 0  \\
  NTF(z) &= 1-z^{-1} \hat{=} 1-\frac{1}{e^{j\omega}} = 2\,; \quad \text{for}\ \omega \rightarrow \pi  \\

\end{align}

### SQNR and ENOB

Having effective noise shaping will increase the Signal-to-Quantazation-Noise-Ratio (SQNR) of the system within the band of interest. The SQNR is fundamentally tied to the "effective number of bits" (ENOB) that can be converted reliably. For a sine wave input to an ideal Nyquist converter, the relation between SNR and the ENOB is given through the following equation.

\begin{align}
  SNR_{dB} = 6.02 \cdot ENOB + 1.76 
\end{align}

For oversampling circuits, the resulting SQNR of a system is tied to the applied OSR.

### 2nd-Order Modulator

A second order Modulator can be realized by simply exchanging the quantizer of the first order system with yet another instance of the first order system, thereby reducing the in-band quantization noise.
The Blockdiagram will end-up like in @fig-loopfilter_sys_2st_order.

![Linear Model of the 2nd-Order Modulator](figures/theory/Simple_2nd_order_Mod_sys.png){#fig-loopfilter_sys_2st_order}

Regarding the noise shaping we will ultimately end up with $NTF_2(z) = (1-z^{-1})^2$, so the square of the previous NTF.
From that we can

| Benefits of $2^{nd}$-Order | Downsides of $2^{nd}$-Order | 
|------|------|
| Better Loopfilter Gain Tolerance  | Added complexity due to extra circuitry  |
| Superior SQNR/OSR trade-off    |  Reduced stability insurance (more limited input range)  |

### Behavioural Analysis/ Confirmation using MATLAB

The behavioural analysis in MATLAB sztarts by setting some specifications for the system, which are the following:

To validate some of the behavioural characteristics, given by the established  theoretical concepts, the following models for the 1st- and 2nd order modulators were used within MATLAB Simulink. We will mainly focus on the results from the 2nd-order model to keep this section more concise
