# VERY IMPORTANT, PLEASE READ

To get the quarto output to behave properly, some steps have to be taken.

1. When parsing data from .raw files, the toolbox will throw a warning. To prevent this, right click on "l.parse()" -> "Go to definition". There, you comment out  line 197 and the warning is gone.

2. Whenever referencing to a figure, some data file, etc. and you compile the whole document ("report_grp4.qmd") the paths specified have to be relative to the main document, otherwise quarto won't find the specified file

3. If you need help with importing .raw files using python, please look at my version in chapters/clock_gen/clock_gen.qmd
