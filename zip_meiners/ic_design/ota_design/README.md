This folder contains 5-transistor design. 
    The ota is designed using gm/Id. 
    The techonology uses 130nm
        The design is done using Xschem.
    It uses Whilson Current Mirror for creating Refrence Current in the differential pair.

    Refer to files added in Sizing folder for more detail on the methodolgy.


Trail_Ota design is just a trail ota design. It is not the final design. It is used to test the design methodology.
