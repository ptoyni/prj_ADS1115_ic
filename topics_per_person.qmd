# topics the members want to cover during the presentation


### Lars
- compare MOD1 and MOD2
- elaborate on oversampling ADCs (vs. Nyquist principle)
- Loopfilter functionality
  - Noise shaping/ NTF (theory and MATLAB relationships)
- general I/O behaviour (analog to PWM (to digital output via filter))
- (perhaps stability (e.g. pole-zero plots))

### Miko


### Priyanka
- Working of switch cap
- working of 5t and telescopic ota
- design procedure (capactitor sizing, ota sizing, slew currents, settling time, noise and offset, swing limits)
- real circuits (5t-ota, telescopic ota, switched cap, **full real idsm**)
