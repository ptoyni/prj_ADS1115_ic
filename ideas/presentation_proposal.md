# **Proposal for the presentation structure**
#### *What COULD the CEMS presentation be about?*
#
##### General idea:
Treating the presentation as a workgroup-/ department meeting, where the conducted work is presented for an administrative audience (e.g. department leads or CEOs) 

##### Outline:

1. Introducing the System and the given problem of a soon to be missing ADC <br>
(formal contextualization of task)  
   
1. Highlighting the benefits (& potential limits) of $\Delta \Sigma$-ADCs (Showcase theoretical understanding)
   + Showcasing references from ADS1115 & behavioral models (meas, etc.) 
 
2. Defining the Requirements of the ADC (internal + interfaces): 
   + System definition
   + Subsystem definition/ explanation (e.g. analog and digital parts)
   + Start on concrete realizations (OpAmp model, etc)
  
3. Present first solution of ADC realization (e.g. PCB approach)

4. Possibly present further solutions for ADC realization (e.g. IC)
